# Project Explanation Video

This folder contains the full **Project Explanation** walkthrough video.

## How to view / download

GitHub sometimes won’t play large `.mp4` files directly in the page.  
To watch/download it reliably:

1. Open `Project explanation.mp4`
2. Click **View raw** to stream or download

If the browser doesn’t play it, use **View raw** and download the file to watch locally.
